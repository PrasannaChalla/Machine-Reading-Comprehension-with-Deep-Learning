# Machine Reading Comprehension with Deep-Learning

Machine reading comprehension is the task of answering a natural language question about a passage. The tasks of machine comprehension and question answering have gained significant popularity over the past few years within the natural language processing community. One of the key factors to the advancement has been the use of neural attention mechanism, which enables the system to focus on a targeted area within a context paragraph. The task is to enable the computer to understand the documents and questions syntactically and semantically and also understand the types of reasoning required to answer the questions. A typical context for machine comprehension looks like the following example:

**Context Paragraph**: In meteorology, precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity. The main forms of precipitation include drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, graupel and hail... Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other raindrops or ice crystals **within a cloud**. Short, intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called “showers”.

**Question**: Where do water droplets collide with ice crystals to form precipitation?

**Answer**: within a cloud
